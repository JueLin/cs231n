## Description:

This repository contains my personal solutions to assignments in an awesome Stanford open course: CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. Really appreciate all course instructors, Prof. Li Fei-fei, Andrej Karpathy and Justin Johnson for providing such comprehensive and rewarding course materials. I highly recommend interested ones to walk through this course ASAP, since firstly it is indeed an excellent one, plus it won't be free-of-charge for following quarters LOL.

Assignments 1 to 3 were completed based on course materials offered in 2016 winter. Assignment 4 was a part of assigment 3 in 2017 winter, the content of which was absent in previous semesters. It adequately covers some recent research topics, including neural style transfer and generative adversarial networks (GAN).
